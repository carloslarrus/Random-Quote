# Quote of the Day

Create random quote app, that shows a random quote when ever the user loads the App(page) or clicks the get random quote button.

1.  Create a function that returns a random quote from the array of
    quotes that's given. Remember that there's a nice function for
    random numbers in the MDN documentation for `Math.rand()`.
